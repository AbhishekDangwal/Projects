 We used pandas library to read the .csv file format to be converted into a data frame such that we could analyse the data. Then we found out that there were no null values present in the dataset, so we can ignore the step of null values removal.  Then we check the datatypes of the variable we found 2 of the variables were string type, so we applied LabelEncoder to treat the same. Also we dropped 2 variables ('nameOrig','nameDest') as they held no contribution for data modeling. Then we observe the correlation between the variables via heatmap, by which we found two of the variables were correlated with nearly 85% with eachother('oldbalanceOrg' and 'newbalanceOrig'). Then we applied 'train_test_split' to split the model in 70-30 and applied 'KNN, SVM, RandomForest and Decision' tree for performance.  We received a score of nearly 75% from each one of them.
